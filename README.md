## Project Background

This project was my first real attempt at creating an interactive world using Unity. The assignment was completed during my second semester of University. The main requirement of the assignment was that we were not supposed to write any code and instead make use of the tools the engine provided. This "game" showcases what can be created in Unity without writing any code. The [Snowy Cabin Report](Snowy%20Cabin%20Report.pdf) document gives more detail on each of the different features implemented.

## Installation
